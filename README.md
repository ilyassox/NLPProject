# Darija Sentiment Analysis with LSTM

This project focuses on sentiment analysis for the Darija language using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It aims to determine whether a given text has a positive or negative sentiment and visualizes the results using Matplotlib.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This project specifically targets the Darija language, which is spoken in Morocco and other parts of North Africa. The goal is to develop a model that accurately classifies the sentiment of Darija text as positive or negative using LSTM networks, which are well-suited for analyzing sequences of data.

## Features

- **NLP Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes natural language processing techniques to analyze the sentiment of Darija text.
- **LSTM Neural Network Model**: Implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to classify text sentiment, capable of capturing long-term dependencies in the data.
- **Matplotlib Visualization**: Visualizes the sentiment analysis results using Matplotlib for easy interpretation.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries
- LSTM Neural Network libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Matplotlib

## Usage

To use the sentiment analysis tool:

1. Input your Darija text into the provided interface.
2. The LSTM neural network model will analyze the text and determine its sentiment.
3. The result (positive or negative sentiment) will be displayed, along with a visualization of the sentiment score using Matplotlib.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/darija-sentiment-analysis.git
